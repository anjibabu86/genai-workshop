            "Black holes can vary in size, from small ones with the mass of a single star to supermassive black holes with millions or even billions of times the mass of our Sun.",
            "The closest known black hole to Earth is about 1,000 light-years away in the constellation Telescopium.",
            "Black holes can 'sing'! They emit gravitational waves that can be detected by instruments like LIGO.",
            "Time behaves differently near a black hole. The closer you get to the event horizon, the slower time moves relative to an outside observer.",
            "Stephen Hawking proposed that black holes can emit radiation, known as Hawking radiation, which can cause them to lose mass and eventually evaporate.",
            "Black holes can merge with each other, creating an even larger black hole and releasing massive amounts of energy in the form of gravitational waves.",
